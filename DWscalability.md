## You have a hypothetical website where people can follow people (like Twitter,
##Instagram), they can follow Topics discussed, and other types of future possible objects.
##Now all of these “follows” come into play when the user decides to view his own profile,
##the stream of activities generated by the users and topics he follows will show up there.
##Suggest a data warehousing solution that will address the problem of scalability.

In order to solve this issue of scalability we need to have a caching mechanism. Based on the user_id(stored in db) and his post_id(stored in db) or topics he follows(stored in db) we need to generate a cache. Once the user goes to his homepage all his data, topics he follows or his posts should load from the cache. This will make it load faster and not lead to reload of all data from the servers again and again.
